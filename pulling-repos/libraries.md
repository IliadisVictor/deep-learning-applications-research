## Library Selection
### Initial Batch Collected
Through keyword searching from combinations of the strings `deep learning,frameworks,libraries,major,top,2022`
on google search engine , and Github search engine following the tag `deep learning` , we collected the following initial batch of deep learning libraries

### Filtered libraries list
From the 17 libraries initially collected we kept only those that are actively maintained as of 2022 and have a project life of more than 5 years . Also , we removed the bottom outliers in terms of popularity(Github Stars) . 

#### First Filtering Results (maintenance and project lifespan):
**From 17 initial down to 7** :
Tensorflow, Keras, MXNET, fast.ai, Brain.js, Pytorch ,BigDL,

#### Second Filtering Results
Removing BigDL due to a vast difference in popularity compared to the other frameworks we intend to use . 
**From 7 to 6 for a final list of**:
Tensorflow, Keras, MXNET, fast.ai, Brain.js, Pytorch
