# deep-learning-applications-research
The objective of this project is to empirically investigate the software engineering practices associated with the development of deep learning applications. This will be done in the following steps.

* Systematically identify major deep learning libraries, e.g. through keyword searching
* Obtain a list of deep learning projects by finding those that have the identified libraries as a dependency. This can be done by analyzing package management configuration files.
* Analyze the projects to answer the following research questions
  * How are parts of the machine learning pipeline implemented?
  * Which parts are engineered (e.g. under configuration management, continuous integration, build automation, testing) using SWEBOK best practices?
  * What tools are used to aid software engineering practices?
  * What tools are missing?
